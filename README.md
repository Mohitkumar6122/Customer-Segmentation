# Customer-Segmentation
## Customer Segementaion using RFM modeling and K-means Clustering

Customer segmentation is a method of dividing customers into groups or clusters on the basis of common characteristics.
In this case 
RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a behavior-based approach grouping customers into segments. It groups the customers on the basis of their previous purchase transactions. How recently, how often, and how much did a customer buy. 
* Recency (R): Who have purchased recently? Number of days since last purchase (least recency)
* Frequency (F): Who has purchased frequently? It means the total number of purchases. ( high frequency)
* Monetary Value(M): Who have high purchase amount? It means the total money customer spent (high monetary value)

RFM modeling groups each customer on basis of their RFM score.

Also K-means algorithm starts with a first group of randomly selected centroids, which are used as the beginning points for every cluster, and then performs iterative (repetitive) calculations to optimize the positions of the centroids.

I used K-means clustering to group each customer according to their RFM score and predicted the Membership of each customer.
